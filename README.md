## My process
I started with building the html. Then stylized using Sass. Used suppplied stylesheet and Invision syle layout for for guidance. I frequently tested  and checked my code through out the entire process. I commited version updates to GitHub several times. Google searches helped tremendously when stuck. I jot a lot of notes as I program to help with my thinking process.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass Compiler
- Jquery
- Slick Carousel

### What I learned

I have grown as a frontend developer by completing this challenge. The more I build projects the more I learn to do as a designer and programer. This is the first I have added animated motion to an image and worked with a slider carousel. Unfortunately, I was not able to get the slider to function properly. I keep getting "failed to load resource" errors. I copied the source code directly from Slick Carousel and open source cdn sites. Still would not fix the bug. I tried to use vanilla JavaScript to code the function. Still could not get it. 

### Continued development

I am eager to continue growing in all aspects of programming. I plan to play around more with building more projects that use JavaScript. My learning will never end and I'm looking forward to growing as professional.
