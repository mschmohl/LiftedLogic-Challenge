LiftedLogic-Challenge solution
This is a solution to the Lifted Logic Challenge Frontend Test

Overview
Instructions:

Use the font Karla (available on Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla)
The navigation bar should always stick to the top of the page.
The background image on the hero banner should have an animation of slowly zooming in and back out.
The image to the left of the “Brent Faiyaz, So Far Gone” content should automatically match the height of the content section to the right of it. Try to avoid setting a fixed height in CSS.
Buttons should have animations on hover state.
“New Releases” section should be a slider with each card (image, title, name, and short paragraph) being a slide.
“New Releases” slider should be navigable with the arrows.
Bonus: Include a full width google map in the page with a custom skin. Add a pin for Lifted Logic’s location, 10261 W 87th St, Overland Park, KS 66212
Do’s and Dont's

Please do not use a CSS framework (e.g. Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.)
Please use the InvisionApp link and provided design documents to help figure out how to style the page.
Use of javascript libraries to assist with functionality is okay (e.g. Slick Carousel, Magnific popup, jQuery )
The layout should be responsive. You can be creative and use your best judgment when determining the layout as the screen size becomes smaller.
Forms do not need to validate or submit. But client-side validation is cool.

My process
I started with building the html. Then stylized using Sass. Used suppplied stylesheet and Invision syle layout for for guidance. I frequently tested and checked my code through out the entire process. I commited version updates to GitHub several times. Google searches helped tremendously when stuck. I jot a lot of notes as I program to help with my thinking process.

Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
CSS Grid
Sass Compiler
Jquery
Slick Carousel
What I learned
I have grown as a frontend developer by completing this challenge. The more I build projects the more I learn to do as a designer and programer. This is the first I have added animated motion to an image and worked with a slider carousel. Unfortunately, I was not able to get the slider to function properly. I keep getting "failed to load resource" errors. I copied the source code directly from Slick Carousel and open source cdn sites. Still would not fix the bug. I tried to use vanilla JavaScript to code the function. Still could not get it.

Continued development
I am eager to continue growing in all aspects of programming. I plan to play around more with building more projects that use JavaScript. My learning will never end and I'm looking forward to growing as professional.
